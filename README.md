# MIT-6837-assignments
In this repository I'm going to push my solutions for 6837 courses from MIT, assignments found on MIT courseware and lessons followed on youtube from Justin Solomon.
I'm also going (or at least try) to complete all of the "extra credits" parts of the assignments.
Implementations won't necesseraly be good, I just want them to work a bit, my goal for this is to learn CG in general with a little OpenGL.

## Assignment 0

### Main Part
Assignment 0 consists in some basic handling of colors and light position using OpenGL, as well as reading meshes from a .obj file.

### Extra Credit
"Easy" part of the extra credit was about spinning an object, displaying the object using display lists or vertex buffers (used display list in this case to try something I've never heard of) and smoothing the color transition. \
"Medium" part of the extra credit was about building some sort of camera, I've kinda done it, but glut doesn't seem as easy to use or supported as glew, I will want to implement a better camera system in the future.
