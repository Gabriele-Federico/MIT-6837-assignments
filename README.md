# MIT-6837-assignments
In this repository I'm going to push my solutions for 6837 courses from MIT, assignments found on MIT courseware and lessons followed on youtube from Justin Solomon.
I'm also going (or at least try) to complete all of the "extra credits" parts of the assignments.

## Assignment 0

### Main Part
Assignment 0 consists in some basic handling of colors and light position using OpenGL, as well as reading meshes from a .obj file.

### Extra Credit
"Easy" part of the extra credit was about spinning an object, displaying the object using display lists or vertex buffers (used display list in this case to try something I've never heard of) and smoothing the color transition
