# MIT-6837-assignments
In this repository I'm going to push my solutions for 6837 courses from MIT, assignments found on MIT courseware and lessons followed on youtube from Justin Solomon.
I'm also going (or at least try) to complete all of the "extra credits" parts of the assignments.

# Assignment 0
Assignment 0 consists in some basing handling of colors in and light position using OpenGL, as well as reading meshes from a .obj file.
